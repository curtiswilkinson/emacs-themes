# Themes
Just a small list of personalised Emacs themes.

## Install

Run the `install.sh` script to copy the themes into the emacs themes directory (this will be created if this does not exist)

**Note: ** This line will need to be present in Emacs config
```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/") 
```

Once this has been added, run `customize-themes` and enable all of the added themes to be run.
